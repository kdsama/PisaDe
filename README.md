I am new to express js / node js / coding / webworld .
I have made a login page using express 4.0 / mysql and ejs as templating engine . 
Sessions have been managed but without the use of cookies . It seems you can avoid cookies if you add one or two arguments to the session usage . 
Next up will be making this website work like splitwise do , but a little more complex thats it . 
what i intend to add in near future :- wow.js for animation , passport.js for authentication
